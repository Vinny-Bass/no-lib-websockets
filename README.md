# no-lib-websockets

no-lib-websockets is a repo that contains an lightweight and efficient WebSocket server implementation built from scratch using only Node.js internal libraries. This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Node.js in creating real-time communication applications without relying on any external dependencies.

## Features:

- Pure Node.js implementation, without any external libraries or frameworks
- Easy-to-understand and well-organized codebase
- Clear separation of concerns between server and client components
- Demonstrates how to handle WebSocket connection lifecycle events
- Provides a basic example of a real-time chat application

## Why do it from scratch?

- Is good to have a better understanding about websockets
- Know how websockets works prevents you from use http pooling in real life problems :smile:

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/no-lib-websockets.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd no-lib-websockets
```

Install Node.js if you haven't already (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Run the WebSocket server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Open the client.html file in your browser and start interacting with the WebSocket server.

Please feel free to explore the codebase and experiment with modifications to enhance the functionality or performance of the application. Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are always welcome.
